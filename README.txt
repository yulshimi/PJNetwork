To Compile:
g++ -g -std=c++11 main.cpp host.cpp router.cpp runRouter.cpp runReceiver.cpp runSender.cpp utility.cpp as.cpp attackerRouter.cpp runAttackerRouter.cpp

Description:
-Implemented the small network system that consists of five autonomous systems and one sender host and multiple receiver hosts in C++
-Implemented the Border Gateway Protocol with the Breadth First Search, the Longest Prefix Match with Trie, the Internet Control Message Protocol, the Sliding Window Protocol with Selective Acknowledgements, the Address Resolution Protocol, and the Random Early Detection
-Implemented the normal router with multiple input queues and output queues, and the attacker router that
 modifies an original message and manipulates sequence/acknowledgment numbers
